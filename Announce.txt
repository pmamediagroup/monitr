Subject: [ANN] monitr 0.6.0 released (and mailing list)

!!!NEW MAILING LIST!!! We now have a mailing list at http://groups.google.com/group/monitr-rb

This release is primarily focused on increased stability, robustness, and code cleanliness.

The last release (0.5.0) switched from TCP sockets to Unix Domain Sockets for the CLI tools. There were some issues regarding file descriptors that would cause monitr to hang when restarting (the unix socket was being held open by spawned processes). These problems are all fixed in 0.6.0. You may need to kill any processes that were started under monitr 0.5.0 when you upgrade to 0.6.0 (you will only need to do this once during the upgrade process).

More attention is now paid to Syslogging behavior.

Monitr will delete its own PID file when terminated via a user request.

A new command line option now allows you to check whether your installation properly handles events (sometimes the C extension will compile ok, but still not support events. Gentoo, I'm looking at you). Run `monitr check` to see an attempt to use the event system. It will tell you if your installation does not support events.

A watch can now be removed entirely at runtime using `monitr remove <watch name>`.

A new condition DiskUsage allows you to check the available disk space on a given volume.

Updated documentation is now available on the website:

WHAT IS monitr?

Monitr is an easy to configure, easy to extend monitoring framework written in Ruby.

Keeping your server processes and tasks running should be a simple part of your deployment process. Monitr aims to be the simplest, most powerful monitoring application available.


DISCLAIMER

Monitr is still beta so I do not yet recommend you use it for mission critical tasks. We are using it at Powerset, Inc. to monitor our public facing applications, but then, we're daring fellows.


INSTALL

sudo gem install monitr


FEATURES

* Config file is written in Ruby
* Easily write your own custom conditions in Ruby
* Supports both poll and event based conditions
* Different poll conditions can have different intervals
* Easily control non-daemonized processes


EXAMPLE

The easiest way to understand how monitr will make your life better is by looking at a sample config file. The following configuration file is what I use at gravatar.com to keep the mongrels running:

# run with:  monitr -c /path/to/gravatar.monitr
# 
# This is the actual config file used to keep the mongrels of
# gravatar.com running.

RAILS_ROOT = "/Users/tom/dev/gravatar2"

%w{8200 8201 8202}.each do |port|
  Monitr.watch do |w|
    w.name = "gravatar2-mongrel-#{port}"
    w.interval = 30.seconds # default      
    w.start = "mongrel_rails start -c #{RAILS_ROOT} -p #{port} \
      -P #{RAILS_ROOT}/log/mongrel.#{port}.pid  -d"
    w.stop = "mongrel_rails stop -P #{RAILS_ROOT}/log/mongrel.#{port}.pid"
    w.restart = "mongrel_rails restart -P #{RAILS_ROOT}/log/mongrel.#{port}.pid"
    w.start_grace = 10.seconds
    w.restart_grace = 10.seconds
    w.pid_file = File.join(RAILS_ROOT, "log/mongrel.#{port}.pid")
    
    w.behavior(:clean_pid_file)

    w.start_if do |start|
      start.condition(:process_running) do |c|
        c.interval = 5.seconds
        c.running = false
      end
    end
    
    w.restart_if do |restart|
      restart.condition(:memory_usage) do |c|
        c.above = 150.megabytes
        c.times = [3, 5] # 3 out of 5 intervals
      end
    
      restart.condition(:cpu_usage) do |c|
        c.above = 50.percent
        c.times = 5
      end
    end
    
    # lifecycle
    w.lifecycle do |on|
      on.condition(:flapping) do |c|
        c.to_state = [:start, :restart]
        c.times = 5
        c.within = 5.minute
        c.transition = :unmonitored
        c.retry_in = 10.minutes
        c.retry_times = 5
        c.retry_within = 2.hours
      end
    end
  end
end
